# Writing an abstract

---
## What is an abstract?

An abstract gives an overview of your entire research project and usually answers these questions: 

What is your research about? 

Why is it important? 

How did you do it? 

What did you find? 

Why are your findings important? 

---

## What is the purpose of an abstract?

1. Summarizes the study – Gives a brief overview of what the research is about.

2. Helps readers decide – Lets people see if the research is useful to them before reading the whole paper.

3. Gives a quick guide – Shows what to expect in the full article or thesis.

---

## Structured Vs Unstructured Abstract

**Structured Abstract**

Format: Divided into labeled sections (e.g., Background, Methods, Results, Conclusion).

**Unstructured Abstract**

Format: Written as one single paragraph without section headings.

---

## Don'ts in Abstracts:

- No abbreviations – Avoid using short forms unless they are very common and well-known.

- No citations – Don’t refer to other studies or include references.

- No figures or tables – Keep it all in text form only.

- No lengthy background – Be brief and to the point.

- No detailed methods – Only include essential information.

**Keep it clear, concise, and self-contained.**

---

##  Examples

## Storytelling in Research Communication

“Facts tell, but stories sell.” — Storytelling makes your research memorable, relatable, and impactful.

Storytelling in research is not about gossip or casual talk — it’s a purposeful communication tool used to engage, explain, and persuade.

---

# Example Story Telling Process

---

**Set the Scene**
– Give context (When? Where? Who? Why?)
Example: “In 2019, a small town in Sri Lanka experienced its worst dengue outbreak…”

**Introduce the Problem**
– What went wrong? What challenge existed?
Example: “Despite existing mosquito control efforts, the number of cases kept rising.”

**Describe the Journey**
– What did you do? How did you explore or solve it?
Example: “We collected climate and health data across 12 districts and built a forecasting model…”

---

**Deliver the Outcome**
– What did you find or change?
Example: “The model predicted outbreaks 3 weeks in advance with 90% accuracy.”

**Reflect on the Meaning**
– Why does it matter? What’s next?
Example: “This approach could help prevent outbreaks in vulnerable regions.”
---

## Effective Storytelling Hooks for Research

In-class-discussion

---

# Properties of a Good Story

---

**Clear Purpose**

The story supports your main message or research objective.

Every part of the story should guide the audience toward understanding your key point.

Example: A story about a disease outbreak that introduces your forecasting model.

---

**Relatable Characters or Context**

Audiences connect better when there are people or situations they can identify with.

In research, this could be a patient, a researcher, a village, or a decision-maker.

Example: “A local health officer was overwhelmed when dengue cases surged…”

---

**Conflict or Challenge**

Good stories have a problem to solve or a question to answer.

In research, this is often the research gap or the real-world problem you’re addressing.

Example: “Despite spraying, dengue cases kept rising…”

---
**Resolution or Discovery**

The story shows how the problem was tackled, ideally ending with a solution, insight, or lesson learned.

Example: “By integrating weather data into our models, we improved outbreak predictions by 80%.”

---

**Emotional or Intellectual Engagement**

The story should make the audience feel something (curiosity, empathy, urgency) or think deeply.

Tip: Use vivid language, real numbers, or human outcomes to increase impact.

---

**Structure (Beginning, Middle, End)**

A good story has a logical flow:

Beginning: Sets the scene

Middle: Builds the problem/conflict

End: Delivers insight or resolution

---
