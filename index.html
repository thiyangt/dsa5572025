Despite technological advancements, rural students in many countries still lack access to basic educational resources.

---
## Types of hooks (cont.)

**7. Definition Hook**

Define a term or concept that is central to your topic, especially if it has varied meanings.

Example:

Machine learning interpretability refers to the degree to which a human can understand the reasoning behind a machine learning model's predictions.

# Topic sentence 

Topic sentence is the first sentence of a paragraph that introduces the main idea or focus of that paragraph

----

# Topic sentence: Purpose

- It tells the reader what the paragraph is about.

- It acts as a guide for both the writer and the reader.

- It helps with clarity, flow, and coherence in your writing.

---
## A good topic sentence is:

- Clear and specific (not too broad or vague)

- Often connects to the previous paragraph (transition)

- Often introduces a claim or idea that the rest of the paragraph explains or supports

## Literature Review

---
## What are the purposes of a literature review?

- To learn what has already been done

- To identify gaps and opportunities

- To ensure you're not just repeating what others have already done

- To familiarize yourself with the current state of knowledge on your topic

---
## How can I access published research papers?

- Academic databases and search engines

- Speak with the librarian at your institution to find out if you have access to any subscription databases

---
## Free databases/ search engines

- Google scholar

- Directory of Open Access Journal (DOAJ)

- PubMed

- Bielefeld Academic Search Engine (BASE)

- E-Theses Online Service (EThOS)

---
## Free databases/ search engines (cont.)

- Social Science Research Network (SSRN)

- WorldWideScience

- Semantic Scholar - “intelligent” academic search engine. Machine learning algorithm is used to prioritize the most important research

- Public Library of Science (PLOS)

---
## Free databases/ search engines (cont.)

- Microsoft Academic Search

- Dimensions

---
## Databases that are available through subscription

- Scopus

- Web of science

---

If you can access the full text of a paper, it could be because of a number of reasons, for example

- Open access

- Authenticated user

- Author-archived copy

---
## Dealing with paywalls

- Speak with the librarian

- Write to the corresponding author

- Use unpaywall to see if there is an open access version of the full text of the paper

---
## What is unpaywall?

Browser extension that will automatically point out full text or open-access version of research papers

Example: https://unpaywall.org/

---
## Preprints and repositories

- arXiv

- bioRxiv

- Institutional repositories

- OpenDOAR website

---
##  Ways to structure a literature review

 1. Thematic Structure (by topic/theme)
 
 2. Chronological Structure (by time)
 
 3. Methodological Structure (by method/model)

 
---
## What are the different types of review? 

- Systematic Reviews

- Meta-Analyses

- Umbrella

- Comparative Effectiveness

- Scoping

- Rapid

- Narrative
